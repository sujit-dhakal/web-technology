# Chapter 1: Web Basics - Part 1
## Internet, Intranet, and World Wide Web

### 1. The Internet

**What is the Internet?**

The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices connected together. Think of it as a massive highway system where information travels instead of cars. With the Internet, you can access information, communicate with anyone worldwide, and do much more.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Global Network**: Connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks
- **Public Access**: Anyone can access it (with proper equipment and connection)
- **Decentralized**: No single entity owns or controls the entire Internet
- **Packet Switching**: Data is broken into small packets that travel independently

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine the Internet as a postal system for the entire world. Just as letters travel through various post offices to reach their destination, data travels through various network points to reach its destination.

**Example:**
When you send an email from Nepal to the United States:
1. Your email leaves your computer
2. It travels through your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
3. It passes through multiple routers and networks
4. Finally reaches the recipient's email server
5. The recipient downloads it to their device

### 2. Intranet

**What is an Intranet?**

An Intranet is a private network that is contained within an organization. It uses the same technologies as the Internet (web browsers, web servers, etc.) but is accessible only to authorized members of that organization.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Private Network**: Restricted to organization members only
- **Secure**: Protected by firewalls and authentication systems
- **Internal Use**: Used for sharing resources, information, and collaboration within an organization
- **Limited Scope**: Confined to a specific organization or company

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of an Intranet as a private library within a company. Only employees with proper ID cards can enter and access the books and resources inside.

**Example:**
A university might have an Intranet where:
- Students can access course materials
- Faculty can upload grades
- Staff can submit leave applications
- Only people with university credentials can log in

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature | Internet | Intranet |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Access | Public (worldwide) | Private (organization only) |
| Security | Lower (open network) | Higher (protected by firewalls) |
| Size | Unlimited (global) | Limited (organization-specific) |
| Users | Anyone with connection | Authorized members only |
| Cost | Varies by ISP | Maintained by organization |
| Purpose | Global communication | Internal collaboration |

### 3. World Wide Web (WWW)

**What is the World Wide Web?**

The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a service that runs on the Internet. It's a collection of interconnected documents and resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs. Many people confuse the Web with the Internet, but they're different!

**Important Distinction:**
- **Internet** = The infrastructure (the hardware, cables, routers, servers)
- **World Wide Web** = A service that uses the Internet (one of many services)

**Key Components:**
1. **Web Pages**: Documents formatted in HTML
2. **Hyperlinks**: Connections between web pages
3. **Web Browsers**: Software to view web pages (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. **Web Servers**: Computers that store and serve web pages
5. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for transferring web pages

**Real-World Analogy:**
If the Internet is a highway system, the World Wide Web is like all the destinations you can visit using that highway system—shops, libraries, entertainment venues, etc.

**Example:**
When you type `www.google.com` in your browser:
1. Your browser (client) sends a request over the Internet
2. Google's web server receives the request
3. The server sends back the Google homepage (HTML, CSS, images)
4. Your browser displays the page
5. You can click hyperlinks to navigate to other pages

**History:**
- **1989**: Tim Berners-Lee invented the WWW while working at CERN
- **1991**: The first website went live
- **1993**: Web became freely available to everyone
- **Today**: Billions of websites exist

### Key Differences: Internet vs. WWW

### Summary

- **Internet**: The global network infrastructure connecting billions of devices
- **Intranet**: A private network within an organization using Internet technologies
- **WWW**: A service running on the Internet, consisting of interconnected web pages accessed via browsers

All three work together in modern computing, but each serves a different purpose and operates at a different level.
