## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### Internet, Intranet, WWW
- **Internet**: Global network infrastructure
- **Intranet**: Private organizational network
- **WWW**: Service of interconnected web pages running on Internet

### Web Pages
- **Static**: Fixed content, same for all users (HTML/CSS)
- **Dynamic**: Personalized content, database-driven (PHP/Python + Database)

### Client-Server
- **Client**: Requests resources (browser)
- **Server**: Provides resources (web server)
- **Architecture tiers**: 1-tier (standalone), 2-tier (client-database), 3-tier (presentation-logic-data), N-tier (multiple specialized layers)

### HTTP
- **Protocol**: Rules for web communication
- **Request**: Client asks for resource
- **Response**: Server provides resource with status code
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

### URL
- **Format**: `scheme://domain:port/path?query#fragment`
- **Example**: `https://shop.com/products?category=laptop#reviews`

### Scripting
- **Client-Side**: JavaScript in browser (fast, visible)
- **Server-Side**: PHP/Python on server (secure, database access)

### Web Evolution
- **Web 1.0**: Read-only, static (1991-2004)
- **Web 2.0**: Read-write, social, interactive (2004-present)
